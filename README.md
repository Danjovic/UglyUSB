# UglyUSB
USB HID keyboard simulator device for automatic typing of scripts

We have seen some Digispark based rubber ducks on the net but so far they all suffer from limited amount of memory for scripts. Not anymore!

Ugly USB is a Digispark with a 64Kbyte I2C EEPROM so it can provide plenty of space for the scripts. But hey, this is cool!, What's What's Ugly on that?

Well, besides the shameless reference to the western movie, the price for the lunch is that the uploading of the scripts takes three steps:

* Upload EEPROM firmware loader
* Upload the EEPROM contents using PC application
* Upload the script player firmware

You might think this is not so bad, but this is absolutely not beautiful (and I am not even considering the deadbug style mounting)
